# resources compilation (chronological diary)
 day 1:
- learning how to use flask. created a venv. 
starter flask code:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/flask-creating-first-simple-application/
- learning how to use beautifulsoup to scrape webdata from leetcode:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/
- found out web scraping is against leetcode's tos (oops!). instead, i plan to make a small browser extension that reads what the user sees and sends the data to the backend.
- i read up a bit on DOM manipulation (odin project), since i treat the lc webpage as a DOM. then, i read about how browser extensions work (manifest.json, content.js script, fetch())
